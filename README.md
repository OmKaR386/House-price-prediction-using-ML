# House Price Prediction Dataset  

This repository contains a dataset designed for machine learning projects focused on predicting house prices. It includes key property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and neighborhood quality, along with the corresponding market prices.

## Problem Statement  

Develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various property and neighborhood features. The model should leverage the given dataset to understand the relationships between features like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and neighborhood quality, aiming to predict the house price accurately.  

### Objective  

- Predict the variable `House_Price` (target) using other features (inputs) such as `Square_Footage`, `Num_Bedrooms`, `Num_Bathrooms`, `Year_Built`, `Lot_Size`, `Garage_Size`, and `Neighborhood_Quality`.  

### ML Approach  

- Supervised regression modeling (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or Gradient Boosting).  

## Dataset Overview  

- **Rows (Samples):** 1,000  
- **Columns (Features):** 8  

### Features  

| Column Name            | Data Type | Description                                             |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Square_Footage`        | Integer   | Total square footage of the house.                     |
| `Num_Bedrooms`          | Integer   | Number of bedrooms in the house.                       |
| `Num_Bathrooms`         | Integer   | Number of bathrooms in the house.                      |
| `Year_Built`            | Integer   | Year the house was built.                              |
| `Lot_Size`              | Float     | Size of the lot in acres.                              |
| `Garage_Size`           | Integer   | Number of vehicles the garage can accommodate.         |
| `Neighborhood_Quality`  | Integer   | Rating of the neighborhood quality (scale: 1–10).      |
| `House_Price`           | Float     | Market price of the house (in USD).                   |

### Key Use Cases  

- **House Price Prediction:** Build regression models to predict house prices based on property features.  
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Explore how factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood quality influence house prices.  
- **Real Estate Insights:** Assist real estate professionals in evaluating property values.
